I used github for a week, although my programming ability is stagnant, my English level has been greatly improved! 
My task is to write a game that can be played online or with artificial intelligence.
But now, I just finished a very basic graphical interface, which makes me overwhelmed...
The road ahead will be long and our climb will be steep！



I was relieved to see the task so easy. 
Learned to use super(g) to make layer overlaying problems simple. 
About three days can be my own backgammon program optimization and perfection.
